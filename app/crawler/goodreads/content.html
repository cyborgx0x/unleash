    <p>
      Off the bat, for this story to make sense, you should know two things
      about Athena:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, she has everything: a multibook deal straight out of college at a
      major publishing house, an MFA from the one writing workshop everyone’s
      heard of, a résumé of prestigious artist residencies, and a history of
      awards nominations longer than my grocery list. At twenty-seven, she’s
      published three novels, each one a successively bigger hit. For Athena,
      the Netflix deal was not a life-changing event, just another feather in
      her cap, one of the side perks of the road to literary stardom she’s been
      hurtling down since graduation.

      Second, perhaps as a consequence of the first, she has almost no friends.
      Writers our age—young, ambitious up-and-comers just this side of
      thirty—tend to run in packs. You’ll find evidence of cliques all over
      social media—writers gushing over excerpts of one another’s unpublished
      manuscripts (<span class="s13">LOSING MY HEAD OVER THIS WIP!</span>),
      squealing over cover reveals (<span class="s13"
        >THIS IS SO GORGEOUS I WILL DIE!!!</span
      >), and posting selfies of group hangs at literary meet-ups across the
      globe. But Athena’s Instagram photos feature no one else. She regularly
      tweets career updates and quirky jokes to her seventy thousand followers,
      but she rarely @s other people. She doesn’t name-drop, doesn’t blurb or
      recommend her colleagues’ books, and doesn’t publicly rub shoulders in
      that ostentatious, desperate way early career writers do. In the entire
      time I’ve known her, I’ve never heard her reference any close friends but
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to think that she was simply aloof. Athena is so stupidly,
      ridiculously successful that it makes sense she wouldn’t want to mingle
      with mere mortals. Athena, presumably, chats exclusively with blue check
      holders and fellow bestselling authors who can entertain her with their
      rarefied observations on modern society. Athena doesn’t have time to make
      friends with proletarians.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in recent years, I’ve developed another theory, which is that everyone
      else finds her as unbearable as I do. It’s hard, after all, to be friends
      with someone who outshines you at every turn. Probably no one else can
      stand Athena because they can’t stand constantly failing to measure up to
      her. Probably I’m here because I’m just that pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that night it’s only Athena and me at a loud, overpriced rooftop bar in
      Georgetown. She’s flinging back cocktails like she has a duty to prove
      she’s having a good time, and I’m drinking to dull the bitch in me that
      wishes she were dead.

    <p>
      floor at Yale our freshman year, and because we’ve both known we wanted to
      be writers since we were sentient, we ended up in all the same
      undergraduate writing seminars. We both published short stories in the
      same literary magazines early on in our careers and, a few years after
      graduation, moved to the same city—Athena for a prestigious fellowship at
      Georgetown, whose faculty, according to rumor, were so impressed by a
      guest lecture she gave at American University that its English department
      inaugurated a creative writing post just for her, and I because my
      mother’s cousin owned a condo in Rosslyn that she would rent to me for the
      cost of utilities if I remembered to water her plants. We’d never
      experienced anything like kindred spirit recognition, or some deep,
      bonding trauma—we were just always in the same place, doing the same
      things, so it was convenient to be friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although we started out in the same place—Professor Natalia Gaines’s
      Introduction to Short Fiction—our careers spiraled in wildly different
      directions after graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote my first novel in a fit of inspiration during a year spent bored
      out of my skull working for Teach for America. I’d come home after work
      every day to meticulously draft the story I’d wanted to tell since my
      childhood: a richly detailed and subtly magical coming-of-age story about
    </p>
    <p>
      grief, loss, and sisterhood titled&nbsp;<i>Over the Sycamore</i>. After
      I’d queried nearly fifty literary agents without luck, the book was picked
      up by a small press named Evermore during an open call for submissions.
      The advance seemed like an absurd amount of money to me at the time—ten
      thousand dollars up front, with royalties to come once I’d earned out—but
      that was before I learned Athena had gotten six figures for her debut
      novel at Penguin Random House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evermore folded three months before my book went to print. My rights
      reverted back to me. Miraculously, my literary agent—who had signed me
      after Evermore’s initial offer—resold the rights to one of the Big Five
      publishing houses for a twenty-thousand-dollar advance—a “nice deal,” read
      the Publishers Marketplace announcement. It seemed like I had finally Made
      It, that all my dreams of fame and success were about to come true, until
      my launch day drew closer, and my first print run was reduced from ten
      thousand to five thousand copies, my six-city book tour was reduced to
      three stops in the DMV area, and the promised quotes from famous writers
      failed to materialize. I never got a second printing. I sold two, maybe
      three thousand copies total. My editor was fired during one of those
      publishing squeezes that happen every time the economy dips, and I got
      passed along to some guy named Garrett who has so far shown so little
      interest in supporting the novel that I often wonder whether he’s
      forgotten about me entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that’s par for the course, everyone told me. Everyone has a shitty
      debut experience. Publishers are Just Like That. It’s always chaos in New
      York, all the editors and publicists are overworked and underpaid, and
      balls get dropped all the time. The grass is never greener on the other
      side. Every author hates their imprint. There are no Cinderella
      stories—just hard work, tenacity, and repeat attempts at the golden
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why, then, do some people rocket to stardom on their first try? Six
      months before Athena’s debut novel came out, she got a big, sexy photo
      spread in a widely read publishing magazine under the title “Publishing’s
      Newest Prodigy Is Here to Tell the AAPI Stories We Need.” She sold foreign
      rights in thirty different territories. Her debut launched amidst a
      fanfare of critical acclaim in venues like the&nbsp;<i>New Yorker&nbsp;</i
      >and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, and it occupied top spots on every
      bestseller list for weeks. The awards circuit the following year was a
      foregone conclusion. Athena’s debut—<i>Voice and Echo</i>, about a Chinese
      American girl who can summon
    </p>
    <p>
      the ghosts of all the deceased women in her family—was one of those rare
      novels that perfectly straddled the line between speculative and
      commercial fiction, so she accrued nominations for the Booker, Nebula,
      Hugo, and World Fantasy awards, two of which she won. And that was only
      three years ago. She’s published two more books since, and the critical
      consensus is that she’s only gotten better and better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not that Athena isn’t talented. She’s a
      fucking&nbsp;<i>good&nbsp;</i>writer—I’ve read all her work, and I’m not
      too jealous to acknowledge good writing when I see it. But Athena’s star
      power is so obviously not about the writing. It’s about&nbsp;<i>her</i>.
      Athena Liu is, simply put, so fucking cool. Even her name— Athena Ling En
      Liu—is cool; well done, Mr. and Mrs. Liu, to choose a perfect combination
      of the classical and exotic. Born in Hong Kong, raised between Sydney and
      New York, educated in British boarding schools that gave her a posh,
      unplaceable foreign accent; tall and razor-thin, graceful in the way all
      former ballet dancers are, porcelain pale and possessed of these massive,
      long-lashed brown eyes that make her look like a Chinese Anne Hathaway
      (that’s not racist for me to say—Athena once posted a selfie of her and
      “Annie” from some red carpet event, their four enormous doe eyes squeezed
      side by side, captioned simply,&nbsp;<span class="s13">Twins!</span>).
    </p>
    <p>She’s unbelievable. She’s literally unbelievable.</p>
    <p>
      So of course Athena gets every good thing, because that’s how this
      industry works. Publishing picks a winner—someone attractive enough,
      someone cool and young and, oh, we’re all thinking it, let’s just say it,
      “diverse” enough—and lavishes all its money and resources on them. It’s so
      fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that
      have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose. Athena—a beautiful,
      Yale-educated, international, ambiguously queer woman of color—has been
      chosen by the Powers That Be. Meanwhile, I’m just brown-eyed, brown-haired
      June Hayward, from Philly—and no matter how hard I work, or how well I
      write, I’ll never be Athena Liu.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d expected her to skyrocket out of my orbit by now. But the friendly
      texts keep coming—<span class="s13"
        >how’s writing going today? hitting that word count target? good luck
        with your deadline!</span
      >—as do the invitations: happy hour margaritas at El Centro, brunch at
      Zaytinya, a poetry slam on U Street. We have one of those skin-deep
      friendships where you manage to spend a lot of time together without
      really getting to know the other person. I still don’t know if she has any
      siblings. She’s never asked me about my boyfriends. But we keep hanging
    </p>
    <p>
      out, because it’s so convenient that we’re both in DC, and because it’s
      hard to make new friends the older you get.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m honestly not sure why Athena likes me. She always hugs me when she
      sees me. She likes my social media posts at least twice a week. We get
      drinks at least every other month, and most of the time it’s by her
      invitation. But I’ve no clue what I have to offer her—I don’t possess
      anywhere near the clout, the popularity, or the connections to make the
      time she spends with me worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep down, I’ve always suspected Athena likes my company precisely because
      I can’t rival her. I understand her world, but I’m not a threat, and her
      achievements are so far out of my reach that she doesn’t feel bad
      squealing to my face about her wins. Don’t we all want a friend who won’t
      ever challenge our superiority, because they already know it’s a lost
      cause? Don’t we all need someone we can treat as a punching bag?

    </p>
    <p>
      We’re at the Graham’s rooftop bar, sitting on a loveseat facing the
      sunset. Athena is guzzling her second whisky sour, and I’m on my third
      glass of pinot noir. We’ve wandered onto the tired subject of my troubles
      with my publisher, which I deeply regret, because everything Athena thinks
      is comfort or advice always only comes off as rubbing it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t want to piss Garrett off,” I say. “Well, honestly, I think he’s
      just looking forward to rejecting the option so they can be done with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t sell yourself short,” says Athena. “He acquired your debut,
      didn’t he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He didn’t, though,” I say. I have to remind Athena this every single
      time. She has a goldfish’s memory when it comes to my problems—it takes
      two or three repetitions for anything to stick. “The editor who did got
      fired,
    </p>
    <p>
      and the buck passed to him, and every time we talk about it, it feels like
      he’s just going through the motions.”
    </p>
    <p>“Well, then fuck him,” Athena says cheerfully. “Another round?”</p>
    <p>
      The drinks are stupidly expensive at this place, but it’s okay because
      Athena’s buying. Athena always buys; at this point, I’ve stopped offering.
      I don’t think Athena’s ever really grasped the concepts of “expensive” and
      “inexpensive.” She went from Yale to a fully funded master’s degree to
      hundreds of thousands of dollars in her bank account. Once, when I told
      her that entry-level publishing jobs in New York only make about
      thirty-five thousand dollars a year, she blinked at me and asked, “Is that
      a lot?”
    </p>
    <p>“I’d love a malbec,” I say. It’s nineteen dollars a glass.</p>
    <p>
      “Got it, babe.” Athena gets up and saunters toward the bar. The bartender
      smiles at her and she exclaims in surprise, hands flying to mouth like
      she’s Shirley Temple. It seems that one of the gentlemen at the counter
      has sent her a glass of champagne. “Yes,
      we&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>celebrating.” Her dainty, delighted laughter
      floats over the music. “But can I get one for my friend as well? On me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      No one’s out here sending me champagne. But this is typical. Athena gets
      showered by attention every time we go out—if not by eager readers who
      want a selfie and an autograph, then by men and women alike who find her
      ravishing. Me, I’m invisible.

      met the guy who produced&nbsp;<i>Tiger King</i>.&nbsp;<i>Tiger King!</i>”
    </p>
    <p class="s3">
      Be happy for her<span class="p">, I tell myself.&nbsp;</span>Just be happy
      for her, and let her have this night.

      People always describe jealousy as this sharp, green, venomous thing.
      Unfounded, vinegary, mean-spirited. But I’ve found that jealousy, to
      writers, feels more like fear. Jealousy is the spike in my heart rate when
      I glimpse news of Athena’s success on Twitter—another book contract,
      awards nominations, special editions, foreign rights deals. Jealousy is
      constantly comparing myself to her and coming up short; is panicking that
      I’m not writing well enough or fast enough, that&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>am
      not, and never will be, enough. Jealousy means that even just learning
      that Athena’s signing a six-figure option deal with Netflix means that
      I’ll be derailed for days, unable to focus on my own work, mired by shame
      and self-disgust every time I see one of her books in a bookstore display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every writer I know feels this way about someone else. Writing is such a
      solitary activity. You have no assurance that what you’re creating has any
      value, and any indication that you’re behind in the rat race sends you
      spiraling into the pits of despair.&nbsp;<i
        >Keep your eyes on your own paper</i
      >, they say. But that’s hard to do when everyone else’s papers are
      flapping constantly in your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I feel the vicious kind of jealousy, too, watching Athena talk
      about how much she adores&nbsp;<i>her&nbsp;</i>editor, a literary
      powerhouse named Marlena Ng who “plucked me from obscurity” and who “just
      really understands what I’m trying to do on a craft level, you know?” I
      stare at Athena’s brown eyes, framed by those ridiculously large lashes
      that make her resemble a Disney forest animal, and I wonder,&nbsp;<i
        >What is it like to be you?&nbsp;</i
      >What is it like to be so impossibly perfect, to have every good thing in
      the world? And maybe it’s the cocktails, or my overactive writer’s
      imagination, but I feel this hot coiling in my stomach, a bizarre urge to
      stick my fingers in her berry-red-painted mouth and rip her face apart, to
      neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it’s like, she just&nbsp;<i>gets&nbsp;</i>me, like she’s having sex
      with my words. Like, mind sex.” Athena giggles, then scrunches her nose up
      adorably. I suppress the impulse to poke it. “You ever think of the
      revision process as like, having sex with your editor? Like you’re making
      a great big literary baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She’s drunk, I realize. Two and a half drinks in, and she’s smashed; she’s
      already forgotten once again that I, in fact, hate my editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athena doesn’t know how to hold her alcohol. I learned this a week into
      freshman year, at some senior’s house party in East Rock, at which I held
      her hair as she vomited into the toilet bowl. She has fancy taste; she
      loves to show off everything she knows about scotch (she only calls it
      “whisky,” and sometimes “whisky from the Highlands”), but she’s barely had
      anything and her cheeks are already bright red, her sentences rambling.
      Athena loves to get drunk, and drunk Athena is always self-aggrandizing
      and dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first noticed this behavior at San Diego Comic-Con. We were clustered
      around a big table in the hotel bar and she was laughing too loudly,
      cheeks bright red while the guys sitting beside her, one of whom would
      soon be outed on Twitter as a serial sex pest, stared eagerly at her
      chest. “Oh my God,” she kept saying. “I’m not ready for this. It’s all
      going
    </p>
    <p>
      to blow up in my face. I’m not ready. Do you think they hate me? Do you
      think everyone secretly hates me, and no one will tell me?
      Would&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>tell me if you hated me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” the men assured her, petting her hands. “No one could ever hate
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to think this act was a ploy for attention, but she’s also like
      this when it’s only the two of us. She gets so vulnerable. She starts
      sounding like she’s going to burst into tears, or like she’s bravely
      revealing secrets she’s told no one else before. It’s hard to watch.
      There’s something desperate about it, and I don’t know what frightens me
      more—that she’s manipulative enough to pull off such an act, or that
      everything she’s saying might be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the blaring music and bass vibrations, the Graham feels dead—
      unsurprising; it’s a Wednesday night. Two men come up to try to give
      Athena their numbers, and she waves them off. We’re the only women in the
      place. The rooftop feels quiet and claustrophobic in a way that’s
      frightening, so we finish our drinks and leave. I think, with some relief,
      that this will be the end of it—but then Athena invites me over to her
      apartment, a short Lyft ride away, near Dupont Circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come on,” she insists. “I have some amazing whisky saved, precisely for
      this moment—you have to come try it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m tired, and I’m not having that much fun—jealousy feels worse when
      you’re drunk—but I’m curious to see her apartment, so I say yes.

    <p>
      It’s really fucking nice. I knew Athena was rich—bestseller royalties do
      count for something—but I hadn’t processed&nbsp;<i>how&nbsp;</i>rich until
      we step into the ninth-floor, two-bedroom unit where she lives alone—one
      room for sleeping, one room for writing—with tall ceilings, gleaming
      hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a balcony that wraps around
      the corner. She’s decorated it in that ubiquitous, Instagram-famous style
      that screams minimalist but bougie: sleek wooden furniture, sparely
      designed bookshelves, and clean, monochrome carpets. Even the plants look
      expensive. A humidifier hisses beneath her calatheas.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So then, whisky? Or something lighter?” Athena points to the wine fridge.
      She has a fucking wine fridge. “Riesling? Or I have
      this&nbsp;<i>lovely&nbsp;</i>sauvignon blanc, unless you want to stick to
      red—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whisky,” I say, because the only way to get through the rest of this
      night is to get as drunk as possible.
    </p>
    <p>“Neat, on the rocks, or old-fashioned?”</p>
    <p>
      I have no clue how to drink whisky. “Um, whatever you’re having.”
      “Old-fashioned, then.” She darts into her kitchen. Moments later, I
    </p>
    <p>
      hear cupboards opening, dishes clanging. Who knew old-fashioneds were such
      a hassle?
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have this beautiful eighteen-year WhistlePig,” she calls out. “It’s so
      smooth, like toffee and black pepper mixed together—just wait, you’ll
      see.”
    </p>
    <p>“Sure,” I call back. “Sounds great.”</p>
    <p>
      She’s taking a while, and I really have to pee, so I wander around the
      living room searching for the bathroom. I wonder what I’ll find in there.
      Maybe a fancy aromatherapy diffuser. Maybe a basket of jade vagina rocks.
      I notice then that the door to her writing office is wide open. It’s a
      gorgeous space; I can’t help but take a peek. I recognize it from her
      Instagram posts—her “creativity palace,” she calls it. She has a huge
      mahogany desk with curved legs beneath a window framed by Victorian-
    </p>
    <p>style lacy curtains, atop which sits her prized black typewriter.</p>
    <p>
      Right. Athena uses a typewriter. No Word backups, no Google Docs, no
      Scrivener: just scribbles in Moleskine notebooks that become outlines on
      sticky notes that become fully formed drafts on her Remington. It forces
      her to focus on the sentence level, or so she claims. (She’s given this
      interview response so many times I’ve nearly memorized it.) Otherwise, she
      digests entire paragraphs at a time, and she loses the trees for the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>Honestly. Who talks like that? Who&nbsp;<i>thinks&nbsp;</i>like that?</p>
    <p>
      They make these ugly and overpriced electronic typewriters, for authors
      who can’t string together more than a paragraph without losing focus and
      hopping over to Twitter. But Athena hates those; she uses
      a&nbsp;<i>vintage&nbsp;</i>typewriter, a clunky thing that requires her to
      buy special ink ribbons and thick, sturdy pages for her manuscripts. “I
      just can’t write on a screen,” she’s told me. “I have to see it printed.
      Something about the reassuring solidity of the word. It feels permanent,
      like everything I compose has weight. It ties me down; it clarifies my
      thoughts and forces me to be specific.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I wander farther into the office, because I’m exactly drunk enough to
      forget that this is bad manners. There’s a sheet of paper still in the
      carriage, upon which are written just two words:&nbsp;<i>THE END.&nbsp;</i
      >Sitting next to the typewriter is a stack of pages nearly a foot tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athena materializes by my side, a glass in either hand. “Oh, that’s the
      World War One project. It’s finally done.”

      Athena is famously cagey about her projects until they’re finished. No
      beta readers. No interviews, no sharing snippets on social media. Even her
      agents and editors don’t get to see so much as an outline until she’s
      finished the whole thing. “It has to gestate inside me until it’s viable,”
      she told me once. “If I expose it to the world before it’s fully formed,
      it dies.” (I’m shocked no one has called her out for this grotesque
      metaphor, but I guess anything’s okay if Athena says it.) The only things
      she’s revealed over the past two years are that this novel has something
      to do with twentieth-century military history, and that it’s a “big
      artistic challenge” for her.
    </p>
    <p>“Shit,” I say. “Congrats.”</p>
    <p>“Typed up the last page this morning,” she chirps. “No one’s read it</p>
    <p>yet.”</p>
    <p>“Not even your agent?”</p>
    <p>She snorts. “Jared pushes paper and signs checks.”</p>
    <p>
      “It’s so long.” I wander closer to the desk, reach for the first page,
      then
    </p>
    <p>
      immediately withdraw my hand. Stupid, drunk—I can’t just go around
      touching things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of snapping at me, Athena nods her permission. “What do you
      think?”
    </p>
    <p>“You want me to read it?”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, I guess, not all of it, right now.” She laughs.
      “It’s&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>long. I’m just—I’m just so glad it’s finished.
      Doesn’t this stack look pretty? It’s hefty. It . . . carries
      significance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She’s rambling; she’s as drunk as I am, but I know exactly what she means.
      This book is huge, in more ways than one. It’s the sort of book that
      leaves a mark.
    </p>
    <p>My fingers hover over the stack. “Can I . . . ?”</p>
    <p>
      “Sure, sure . . .” She nods enthusiastically. “I have to get used to it
      being out there. I have to give birth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What a bizarre, persistent metaphor. I know reading the pages will only
      fuel my jealousy, but I can’t help myself. I pick a stack of ten or
      fifteen pages off the top and skim through them.
    </p>
    <p>Holy God, they’re good.</p>
    <p>
      I’m not great at reading when I’m tipsy, and my eyes keep sliding to the
      end of every paragraph, but even from a sloppy once-over, I can tell this
    </p>
    <p>
      book is going to dazzle. The writing is tight, assured. There are none of
      the juvenile slipups of her debut work. Her voice has matured and
      sharpened. Every description, every turn of phrase—it all sings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s better than anything I could write, perhaps in this lifetime. “You
      like it?” she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She’s nervous. Her eyes are wide, almost scared; she’s fiddling with her
      necklace as she watches me. How often does she put on this act? How
      forcefully do people shower her with praise when she does?
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s petty, but I don’t want to give that validation to her. Her game
      works with adoring reviewers and fans; it won’t with me.
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” I say flatly. “I can’t really read drunk.”</p>
    <p>
      She looks crestfallen, but only for a moment. I watch her hastily plaster
      on a smile. “Right, duh, that was stupid, of course you don’t want to . .
      .” She blinks at her glass, then at me, and then at her living room.
      “Well, then do you want to just . . . hang?”
    </p>
    <p>So here’s me, just hanging with Athena Liu.</p>
    <p>
      When she’s hammered, it turns out, she’s shockingly banal. She doesn’t
      quiz me about Heidegger, or Arendt, or the half-dozen philosophers she
      loves to name-drop in interviews. She doesn’t go off about what a good
      time she had guest modeling for Prada this one time in Paris (which was
      completely by accident; the director just saw her sitting outside a café
      and asked her to step in). We cackle about celebrities. We both profess
      that the latest twink with puppy-dog eyes in fact does nothing for us, but
      that Cate Blanchett can step on us, always. She compliments my style. She
      asks where I got my shoes, my brooch, my earrings. She marvels at my skill
      at thrifting—“I still get half my stuff from Talbots, I’m such an old
      lady.” I make her laugh with stories about my students, a procession of
      pimply, dull-eyed kids who could waltz into a lower tier Ivy on their
      parents’ legacy connections if they could only score two hundred points
      higher on the SAT, and how their ghostwritten college essays are all an
      exercise in inventing some personal hardship when it’s clear they’ve never
      experienced any. We trade stories about bad dates, about people we knew
      from undergrad, about how we’ve somehow
