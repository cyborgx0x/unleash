    "ĐÊM TÔI CHỨNG KIẾN ATHENA LIU CHẾT, CHÚNG TÔI ĐANG TỔ CHỨC BỮA TIỆC CỔ VỚI HỢP ĐỒNG TRUYỀN HÌNH CỦA CÔ ẤY VỚI NETFLIX.\n",
    "Ngay từ đầu, để mọi người hiểu câu chuyện này, bạn nên biết hai điều về Athena:\n",
    "Thứ nhất, cô ấy có tất cả mọi thứ: một hợp đồng viết nhiều sách trực tiếp từ trường đại học đến một nhà xuất bản lớn, một bằng thạc sĩ văn chương từ một khóa học viết mà ai cũng nghe nói đến, một sơ yếu lý lịch về các kỳ nghỉ nghệ sĩ danh giá và một lịch sử đề cử giải thưởng dài hơn danh sách mua sắm của tôi. Ở tuổi 27, cô đã xuất bản ba cuốn tiểu thuyết, mỗi cuốn đều thành công hơn cuốn trước. Đối với Athena, hợp đồng với Netflix không phải là một sự kiện thay đổi cuộc đời, chỉ là một lợi ích phụ khác trên con đường nổi tiếng văn học mà cô đã từng băng qua từ khi tốt nghiệp đại học.\n",
    "Thứ hai, có lẽ do điều đầu tiên, cô ấy gần như không có bạn bè. Các nhà văn cùng tuổi với chúng tôi - những người trẻ, tham vọng chỉ cách ba mươi một bước - thường sống thành từng nhóm. Bạn sẽ thấy những dấu hiệu về các nhóm nhỏ trên mạng xã hội - những nhà văn khoe trích dẫn từ bản thảo chưa được công bố của nhau (TÔI MẤT HẾT TIN VỀ CUỐN SÁCH NÀY!), rùng mình trước việc tiết lộ bìa sách (NÓ QUÁ ĐẸP TÔI SẼ CHẾT!!!), và đăng ảnh chụp chung của nhóm tại các buổi gặp gỡ văn học trên toàn thế giới. Nhưng ảnh Instagram của Athena không có ai khác. Cô thường xuyên đăng tweet về cập nhật sự nghiệp và những câu nói hài hước độc đáo cho 70 nghìn người theo dõi của mình, nhưng cô hiếm khi kèm tên người khác. Cô không kêu gọi, không đề cập hoặc giới thiệu sách của đồng nghiệp, và không công khai tụ tập cùng người khác một cách hoa mỹ và tuyệt vọng như những nhà văn đầu sự nghiệp khác. Trong suốt thời gian tôi biết cô, tôi chưa bao giờ nghe cô đề cập đến bất kỳ người bạn thân nào ngoại trừ tôi.\n",
    "Trước đây, tôi nghĩ rằng cô ấy đơn giản chỉ là lạnh lùng. Athena quá thành công đến mức ngớ ngẩn, khiến cho việc cô không muốn kết bạn với đám đông hoàn toàn hợp lý. Có lẽ Athena chỉ trò chuyện với những tác giả bán chạy khác và những người có blue check trên mạng xã hội, những người có thể làm cho cô thích thú với những quan sát tinh vi về xã hội hiện đại. Athena không có thời gian để kết bạn với những người bình thường.\n",
    "Nhưng trong những năm gần đây, tôi đã phát triển một lý thuyết khác, đó là mọi người khác cảm thấy cô ấy khó chịu như tôi. Điều đó khó, khi tất cả mọi người không thể chịu đựng việc thất bại liên tục trước Athena. Có lẽ không ai khác có thể chịu đựng Athena vì họ không thể chịu đựng việc liên tục thất bại trước cô ấy. Có lẽ tôi ở đây chỉ vì tôi thực sự đáng thương.\n",
    "Vì vậy, đêm đó chỉ có Athena và tôi ở một quầy bar trên mái nhà ồn ào và đắt tiền ở Georgetown. Cô ấy uống cocktail một cách vội vã như thể cô ấy có nghĩa vụ chứng minh rằng cô ấy đang có một khoảng thời gian vui vẻ, và tôi uống để làm dịu cái bà chằn bên trong tôi muốn cô ấy chết.\n",
    "ATHENA VÀ TÔI CHỈ TRỞ THÀNH BẠN BÈ VÌ TRÁI NGHỊCH. CHÚNG TÔI SỐNG ở cùng một tầng tại Yale từ năm đầu tiên, và vì chúng tôi đều biết rằng chúng tôi muốn trở thành nhà văn từ khi chúng tôi còn nhỏ, chúng tôi đã tham gia vào cùng những khóa học viết sáng tác đại học. Chúng tôi đều đã xuất bản những câu chuyện ngắn trong những tạp chí văn học giống nhau từ sớm trong sự nghiệp của chúng tôi và, một vài năm sau khi tốt nghiệp, chúng tôi đã chuyển đến cùng một thành phố - Athena để thực hiện học bổng danh giá tại Georgetown, nơi giảng viên, theo tin đồn, đã rất ấn tượng với bài giảng của cô tại trường Đại học Mỹ mà khoa tiếng Anh của nó đã khởi xướng một vị trí viết sáng tác chỉ dành riêng cho cô; và tôi vì người chị họ của mẹ tôi sở hữu một căn hộ ở Rosslyn mà cô ấy sẽ cho tôi thuê với giá chỉ bằng tiền điện nước nếu tôi nhớ tưới cây cho cô ấy. Chúng tôi chưa bao giờ trải qua bất kỳ trạng thái tâm linh hoặc những nỗi đau chung nào - chúng tôi chỉ luôn ở cùng một nơi, làm cùng những điều giống nhau, vì vậy việc thân thiện là thuận tiện.\n",
    "Nhưng mặc dù chúng tôi bắt đầu ở cùng một nơi - môn giảng dạy văn chương ngắn của Giáo sư Natalia Gaines - sự nghiệp của chúng tôi đã đi theo hướng khác nhau một cách điên rồ sau khi tốt nghiệp.\n",
    "Tôi đã viết cuốn tiểu thuyết đầu tiên của mình trong một cơn cảm hứng trong một năm làm việc buồn chán với Teach for America. Mỗi ngày, sau khi làm việc, tôi trở về nhà để viết câu chuyện mà tôi muốn kể từ khi còn nhỏ: một câu chuyện về tuổi dậy thì phong phú và tinh tế về ma thuật về sự mất mát và tình chị em, có tựa đề Over the Sycamore. Sau khi tôi đã truy vấn gần 50 đại lý văn học mà không thành công, cuốn sách đã được nhà xuất bản nhỏ Evermore nhận và xuất bản trong cuộc tuyển chọn mở. Tiền tạm ứng lúc đó dường như là một số tiền vô lý - mười ngàn đô la trước, với tiền hoa hồng sẽ đến khi tôi đã trả hết - nhưng đó là trước khi tôi biết Athena đã nhận được sáu chữ số cho cuốn tiểu thuyết ra mắt đầu tiên của cô ở Penguin Random House.\n",
    "Evermore đóng cửa ba tháng trước khi cuốn sách của tôi được in. Quyền sở hữu trở lại với tôi. Một cách kỳ diệu, đại lý văn học của tôi - người đã ký hợp đồng với tôi sau khi Evermore đưa ra đề nghị ban đầu - đã bán lại quyền sở hữu cho một trong những nhà xuất bản thuộc Big Five với một tiền tạm ứng hai mươi ngàn đô la - \"một thỏa thuận tốt,\" như thông báo trên Publishers Marketplace. Dường như tôi đã thành công, mọi giấc mơ về danh tiếng và thành công của tôi sắp trở thành sự thật, cho đến khi ngày ra mắt cuốn sách của tôi gần kề, và số lượng in lần đầu của tôi đã giảm từ mười nghìn xuống còn năm nghìn bản, chuyến lưu diễn quảng bá sách gồm sáu thành phố của tôi đã giảm xuống ba điểm dừng ở khu vực DMV, và những lời khen từ những nhà văn nổi tiếng đã không xuất hiện. Tôi không bao giờ có cuộc in ấn thứ hai. Tôi đã bán được hai, có lẽ ba nghìn cuốn sách. Biên tập viên của tôi đã bị sa thải trong một trong những cuộc ép xuất bản đó xảy ra mỗi khi nền kinh tế suy thoái, và tôi đã được chuyển giao cho một anh chàng tên Garrett mà cho đến nay đã cho thấy quan tâm rất ít đến việc ủng hộ cuốn tiểu thuyết của tôi, đôi khi tôi thậm chí tự hỏi liệu anh ta có quên tôi hoàn toàn không.\n",
    "Nhưng đó là những gì mọi người nói với tôi. Mọi người đều có một trải nghiệm xuất bản khó khăn. Nhà xuất bản chỉ làm việc như vậy. Luôn luôn hỗn loạn ở New York, tất cả các biên tập viên và nhà quảng cáo đều làm việc quá sức và nhận lương quá thấp, và việc làm mắc lỗi xảy ra liên tục. Cỏ không bao giờ xanh hơn bên kia. Mọi tác giả đều ghét nhà xuất bản của họ. Không có câu chuyện Công chúa Lọ Lem - chỉ có công việc chăm chỉ, sự kiên nhẫn và sự thử lại lần sau với vé vàng.\n",
    "Vậy tại sao, một số người lại nổi tiếng ngay từ lần thử đầu tiên? Sáu tháng trước khi cuốn tiểu thuyết ra mắt đầu tiên của Athena, cô đã có một bản trình bày ảnh lớn, quyến rũ trên một tạp chí xuất bản được đọc rộng rãi với tựa đề \"Người kỳ tích mới của ngành xuất bản đã đến để kể những câu chuyện AAPI chúng ta cần.\" Cô đã bán quyền nước ngoài ở ba mươi lãnh thổ khác nhau. Cuốn sách ra mắt của cô được phát hành trong không khí của sự khen ngợi từ các tạp chí như New Yorker và New York Times, và nó đã chiếm vị trí hàng đầu trên mọi danh sách sách bán chạy trong nhiều tuần. Chuỗi giải thưởng năm sau là điều không cần phải bàn cãi. Cuốn tiểu thuyết ra mắt của Athena - Voice and Echo, về một cô gái gốc Hoa Kỳ có thể triệu hồi những hồn ma của tất cả phụ nữ đã mất trong gia đình cô - là một trong những cuốn tiểu thuyết hiếm hoi hoàn hảo xen giữa tiểu thuyết đặc biệt và tiểu thuyết thương mại, vì vậy cô nhận được đề cử cho giải Booker, Nebula, Hugo và World Fantasy, trong đó cô đã giành được hai giải. Và chỉ cách đây ba năm. Cô đã xuất bản thêm hai cuốn sách nữa, và nhận xét của giới phê bình là cô càng ngày càng tốt hơn và tốt hơn.\n",
    "Không phải Athena không có tài. Cô ấy là một nhà văn giỏi - tôi đã đọc tất cả tác phẩm của cô ấy, và tôi không ghen tị đến mức không thể công nhận được viết tốt khi tôi nhìn thấy nó. Nhưng sức hút của Athena rõ ràng không phải vì viết lách. Đó là về cô ấy. Athena Liu, đơn giản là quá tuyệt vời. Thậm chí cái tên của cô ấy - Athena Ling En Liu - cũng rất tuyệt vời; tốt lắm, ông bà Liu, đã chọn một sự kết hợp hoàn hảo giữa cổ điển và kỳ lạ. Sinh ra tại Hồng Kông, lớn lên giữa Sydney và New York, được giáo dục tại các trường nội trú Anh quốc khiến giọng điệu nước ngoài của cô trở nên sang trọng và khó xác định; cao và siêu mỏng, duyên dáng như tất cả các vũ công ballet trước đây, trắng tự nhiên và có đôi mắt nâu dài lúc nào cũng thấy như con nai của Trung Quốc (đó không phải là điều phân biệt chủng tộc khi tôi nói - Athena từng đăng một bức tự chụp của cô ấy và \"Annie\" từ một sự kiện thảm đỏ nào đó, bốn đôi mắt hươu nai khổng lồ của họ bị ép lại cạnh nhau, chỉ đơn giản là chúng tôi giống nhau!).\n",
    "Cô ấy không thể tin được. Cô ấy thực sự không thể tin được.\n",
    "Vì vậy, tất nhiên Athena nhận được mọi điều tốt đẹp, vì đó là cách ngành này hoạt động. Nhà xuất bản chọn một người chiến thắng - ai đó đủ hấp dẫn, ai đó trẻ và phong cách, ôi, chúng ta đều nghĩ vậy, hãy chỉ nói ra đi, đủ \"phong phú\" - và trút hết tiền và nguồn lực của mình vào họ. Điều đó quá tùy ý. Hoặc có lẽ không tùy ý, nhưng nó phụ thuộc vào những yếu tố không liên quan đến sức mạnh của câu chữ. Athena - một người phụ nữ gốc Hoa Kỳ, xinh đẹp, được giáo dục tại Yale, quốc tịch quốc tế, mơ hồ về giới tính - đã được các thế lực lựa chọn. Trong khi đó, tôi chỉ là June Hayward, mắt nâu, tóc nâu, từ Philly - và cho dù tôi làm việc chăm chỉ đến đâu, viết tốt đến đâu, tôi sẽ không bao giờ trở thành Athena Liu.\n",
    "Tôi đã mong rằng cô ấy đã bay ra xa khỏi tầm tay tôi bây giờ. Nhưng tin nhắn thân thiện vẫn tiếp tục đến - công việc viết tiến triển như thế nào? đạt được mục tiêu số từ hôm nay chưa? chúc may mắn với tiến độ của bạn! - cũng như những lời mời: margaritas giờ vui vẻ tại El Centro, bữa brunch tại Zaytinya, một cuộc thi thơ trên đường U. Chúng tôi có một trong những mối quan hệ bạn bè chỉ ở mức da mỏng, nơi bạn có thể dành rất nhiều thời gian cùng nhau mà không thực sự hiểu biết người khác. Tôi vẫn không biết cô ấy có anh chị em ruột không. Cô ấy chưa bao giờ hỏi tôi về bạn trai của tôi. Nhưng chúng tôi vẫn tiếp tục gặp mặt, vì nó rất thuận tiện khi chúng tôi cùng ở Washington DC, và vì khi bạn càng già, càng khó kết bạn mới.\n",
    "Thực sự, tôi không chắc tại sao Athena thích tôi. Cô ấy luôn ôm tôi khi gặp tôi. Cô ấy thích bài viết trên mạng xã hội của tôi ít nhất hai lần mỗi tuần. Chúng tôi đi uống rượu ít nhất mỗi hai tháng, và hầu hết thời gian là do cô ấy mời. Nhưng tôi không biết tôi có gì để cung cấp cho cô ấy - tôi không có sức ảnh hưởng, sự phổ biến hoặc mối quan hệ để làm cho thời gian cô ấy dành với tôi đáng giá.\n",
    "Trong tâm tư, tôi luôn nghi ngờ rằng Athena thích tôi chính vì tôi không thể cạnh tranh với cô ấy. Tôi hiểu thế giới của cô ấy, nhưng tôi không đe dọa, và thành tựu của cô ấy ở một mức không thể đạt được đối với tôi. Chúng ta có muốn một người bạn không bao giờ thách thức sự vượt trội của chúng ta, vì họ đã biết rằng nó là một sự thất bại không thể đánh bại? Chúng ta có cần một người chúng ta có thể xem như một chiếc bao đựng đồ?\n",
    "\"KHÔNG THỂ TỒI TỆ NHƯ VẬY,\" ATHENA NÓI. \"TÔI CHẮC CHỈ LÀ CÁI nghĩa là họ đang trì hoãn bản bìa mềm một vài tháng.\"\n",
    "\"Nó không bị trì hoãn,\" tôi nói. \"Nó đã bị hủy bỏ. Brett nói với tôi rằng họ chỉ... không thể tìm được chỗ cho nó trong lịch in ấn của họ.\"\n",
    "Cô ấy vỗ vai tôi. \"Ôi, đừng lo. Bạn sẽ nhận được nhiều tiền hoa hồng từ bìa cứng hơn! Mặt tích.\"\n",
    "Dũng cảm của bạn khi cho rằng tôi nhận được tiền hoa hồng. Tôi không nói lên điều đó. Nếu bạn chỉ trích Athena vì thiếu tế nhị, cô ấy sẽ hối tiếc một cách quá đáng, và điều đó khó chịu hơn việc nuốt chửng sự tức giận của tôi.\n",
    "Chúng tôi đang ở trên mái nhà của Graham, ngồi trên một chiếc ghế tình yêu đối diện với hoàng hôn. Athena đang uống ly whisky sour thứ hai của mình, và tôi đang uống ly thứ ba của tôi. Chúng tôi đã nói về những khó khăn của tôi với nhà xuất bản, điều mà tôi thực sự hối hận, vì mọi thứ mà Athena nghĩ là sự an ủi hoặc lời khuyên luôn khiến tôi cảm thấy như đang bị chà đạp.\n",
    "\"Tôi không muốn làm Garrett tức giận,\" tôi nói. \"Chà, thực ra, tôi nghĩ anh ấy chỉ mong đợi từ chối tùy chọn để họ có thể chấm dứt việc làm với tôi.\"\n",
    "\"Ôi, đừng tự ti,\" Athena vui vẻ nói. \"Anh ấy đã mua quyền sở hữu cuốn tiểu thuyết ra mắt của bạn, phải không?\"\n",
    "\"Anh ấy không, thế nhưng,\" tôi nói. Tôi phải nhắc Athena điều này mỗi lần. Cô ấy như một con cá vàng khi nói về những vấn đề của tôi - cần phải lặp lại hai hoặc ba lần cho bất kỳ điều gì mới ghi nhớ. \"Biên tập viên đã mua quyền sở hữu của tôi đã bị sa thải, và anh ta nhận lại, và mỗi lần chúng tôi nói về điều đó, có vẻ như anh ta chỉ làm theo quy trình.\"\n",
    "\"Vậy thì đụng đến anh ấy,\" Athena vui vẻ nói. \"Uống thêm một vòng nữa?\"\n",
    "Đồ uống ở quán này đắt đỏ, nhưng không sao vì Athena đang trả tiền. Athena luôn mua; đến lúc này, tôi đã ngừng đề nghị. Tôi không nghĩ Athena thật sự hiểu khái niệm \"đắt\" và \"rẻ\". Cô ấy đã từ Yale đến một chương trình thạc sĩ được tài trợ đầy đủ đến hàng trăm ngàn đô la trong tài khoản ngân hàng của mình. Một lần, khi tôi nói với cô ấy rằng các công việc xuất bản cấp nhập môn ở New York chỉ kiếm khoảng ba mươi nghìn đô la một năm, cô ấy nhìn chằm chằm vào tôi và hỏi: \"Đó có phải là một số lớn không?\"\n",
    "\"Tôi muốn có một ly rượu malbec,\" tôi nói. Một ly có giá mười chín đô la.\n",
    "\"Đã hiểu, em yêu.\" Athena đứng dậy và đi về phía quầy bar. Người pha chế cười với cô ấy và cô ấy kinh ngạc, tay vỗ vào miệng như cô bé Shirley Temple. Có vẻ như một trong những người đàn ông ở quầy đã gửi cho cô ấy một ly rượu sâm banh. \"Vâng, chúng ta đang ăn mừng.\" Tiếng cười nhỏ nhẹ, vui mừng của cô ấy bay trên nhạc. \"Nhưng có thể tôi lấy thêm một ly cho bạn? Tôi trả tiền.\"\n",
    "Không ai gửi rượu sâm banh cho tôi. Nhưng điều này là bình thường. Athena luôn được tặng quà mỗi khi chúng tôi ra ngoài - nếu không phải từ độc giả hào hứng muốn chụp ảnh selfie và lấy chữ ký, thì từ đàn ông và phụ nữ muốn cô ấy. Trong khi đó, tôi thì trở nên vô hình.\n",
    "\"Vậy thôi.\" Athena ngồi lại bên cạnh tôi và đưa cho tôi ly rượu của tôi. \"Bạn có muốn nghe về cuộc họp với Netflix không? Ồ Chúa ơi, Junie, nó thật điên rồ. Tôi đã gặp người sản xuất Tiger King. Tiger King!\"\n",
    "Hãy vui cho cô ấy, tôi tự nhủ. Hãy chỉ vui cho cô ấy và để cô ấy có một đêm này.\n",
    "Mọi người luôn miêu tả sự ghen tị như một thứ độc tố xanh lợt, có độc, ác độc. Nhưng tôi đã thấy rằng đối với những nhà văn, sự ghen tị cảm giác giống như sự sợ hãi hơn. Sự ghen tị là nhịp đập nhanh trong tim tôi khi tôi nhìn thấy tin tức về thành công của Athena trên Twitter - một hợp đồng viết sách khác, đề cử giải thưởng, bản phát hành đặc biệt, quyền nước ngoài. Sự ghen tị là so sánh liên tục bản thân với cô ấy và thấy mình thua cuộc; là hoảng loạn rằng tôi không viết đủ tốt hoặc đủ nhanh, rằng tôi không đủ, và sẽ không bao giờ đủ. Sự ghen tị có nghĩa là ngay cả việc biết rằng Athena đang ký một hợp đồng tùy chọn với Netflix trị giá sáu chữ số cũng có nghĩa là tôi sẽ bị lạc hướng trong vài ngày, không thể tập trung vào công việc của mình, chìm trong sự xấu hổ và tự ghê tởm mỗi khi thấy một cuốn sách của cô ấy trong một quầy sách.\n",
    "Mỗi nhà văn tôi biết đều cảm thấy như vậy với người khác. Viết lách là một hoạt động cô đơn. Bạn không có bất kỳ đảm bảo nào rằng những gì bạn đang tạo ra có giá trị, và bất kỳ biểu hiện nào cho thấy bạn đang đuổi theo trong cuộc đua chuột gặp phải sự sụp đổ. Hãy tập trung vào bài của bạn, họ nói. Nhưng điều đó rất khó khi bài của mọi người khác liên tục bay vào mặt bạn.\n",
    "Mặc dù tôi cảm thấy ghen tị ác độc khi xem Athena nói về cách cô ấy yêu quý biên tập viên của mình, một người phụ nữ quyền lực văn học có tên Marlena Ng, người \"chọn tôi từ sự vô danh\" và người \"thực sự hiểu được những gì tôi đang cố gắng làm ở mức độ nghệ thuật, bạn biết chứ?\" Tôi nhìn chằm chằm vào đôi mắt nâu của Athena, được bao quanh bởi những sợi mi quá to khiến cô ấy giống một con vật trong rừng của Disney, và tôi tự hỏi, Làm thế nào để trở thành bạn? Làm thế nào để trở thành người hoàn hảo đến khó tin, có tất cả những điều tốt đẹp trên thế giới? Và có lẽ do những ly cocktail hoặc trí tưởng tượng của nhà văn hoạt bát của tôi, tôi cảm thấy sự xoắn nóng trong dạ dày, một cảm giác lạ lùng muốn đặt ngón tay vào miệng đầy son đỏ của cô ấy và xé nát khuôn mặt cô ấy, như lột da cô ấy ra khỏi cơ thể như một quả cam và kéo khóa nó lên trên tôi.\n",
    "\"Và nó giống như, cô ấy chỉ hiểu tôi, như cô ấy đang quan hệ tình dục với những từ của tôi. Như, tình dục trong tâm trí.\" Athena cười, sau đó nhăn mày xinh xắn. Tôi đè nén cảm giác muốn nhấn vào đó. \"Bạn có bao giờ nghĩ quá trình chỉnh sửa giống như quan hệ tình dục với biên tập viên của bạn không? Như bạn đang tạo ra một đứa bé văn học to lớn?\"\n",

I was still in NYC, struggling through my underpaid, understimulating Teach for America year, but I know as well as anyone the story of their disastrous implosion, a messy affair that played out on Twitter and Instagram for the entire world to see. From what I understand, Geoff and Athena met at a writers\\u2019 residency in Oregon, back when both were young, up-and-coming hotshots. She was months away from the launch of her first novel; he was fresh off signing his first deal with a small but prestigious genre publishing house. Their coupling was foreordained; they were both hot and for the most part straight, both prodigies on the verge of taking the publishing world by storm. I suppose Geoff\\u2019s study-abroad year in Beijing was part of the attraction (though after they broke up, Athena would complain to me how \\u201cGeoff\\u2019s Chinese name was Jie Fu, and he wanted me to call him that when we were alone, and isn\\u2019t that just so fucking weird?

We might even compare Geoff\\u2019s publication history to mine. He started out strong with dozens of award-winning publications in prestigious short-story magazines. But his first novel, a self-proclaimed \\u201cgenre-bending thriller\\u201d about \\u201crace-hopping\\u201d androids in a near-future society, failed to make the expected splash. A reviewer at\\u00a0Locus\\u00a0called it \\u201ca confused and ultimately misguided, possibly malicious, exploration of postraciality and racial fluidity.\\u201d My debut novel didn\\u2019t sell very well, but at least no reviewers ever said that I should \\u201ckeep the ill-considered and shallow philosophizing to undergraduate bars and off the page where grown adults can see.\\u201d\"},\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{\"text\":\"Geoff was very miffed by this particular review, and he wrote up some long and embarrassing blog post about how he\\u2019d been misread, and how the\\u00a0Locus\\u00a0reviewer didn\\u2019t have the \\u201cintellectual range\\u201d to appreciate the complexity and radicalness of his racial critique.

One should also mention that before his debut flopped, Geoff published a series of short stories about an android girl named Xiao Li who puts up with a number of abuses from lecherous human clients before self-destructing in a blast that destroys over half of New Beijing. The stories, Geoff argued, were a scorching interrogation of colonial misogyny, AI rights, and Chinese patriarchy. Someone on Twitter asked him how he had researched all the Chinese phrases he\\u2019d littered through the text; Geoff blithely responded that he was dating a \\u201clong-haired dictionary.\\u201d (That made the Twitter rounds for days.) There were also allegations of drunk groping at bars and an account that looks suspiciously like Geoff\\u2019s on a well-known porn site with \\u201cgot that yellow FEVER!\\u201d in the bio, but we\\u2019re all too polite to bring that up in company.\"},\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{\"text\":\"So Geoff\\u2019s book flopped.

His agent dropped him for \\u201cpersonal and private reasons.\\u201d The sequel to his first book remains under contract, but it\\u2019s unclear whether that will ever see the light of day, assuming Geoff is still trying to finish it.\"},\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{\"text\":\"Who really knows what happened?
